Campus Resource Reservation API - Project Scope
System Purpose
The Campus Resource Reservation API is responsible for managing the reservation and availability of campus resources. This backend system serves as the central platform for tracking, booking, and managing shared campus facilities and equipment.
Resources Managed
The system will manage the following types of campus resources:

Study Rooms - Private and group study spaces
Lab Spaces - Computer labs, science labs, and specialized workspaces
Equipment - Laptops, projectors, cameras, and other borrowable items

User Actions
Users will be able to perform the following actions through the API:

View available resources and their schedules
Create reservations for resources
View their own reservations
Update or cancel existing reservations
Check resource availability for specific time periods

Out of Scope
The system will not handle:

User authentication and account management (assumed to be handled by campus SSO)
Payment processing or fees
Email notifications or reminders
Mobile app development (API only)
Physical access control or door locks
Resource maintenance tracking

Technology Stack
Required Technologies

Node.js - Server-side JavaScript runtime
Express.js - Web framework for building the API
MySQL - Database for storing resource and reservation data
GitHub - Version control and code repository

Why Consistent Tooling Matters
Using a standardized technology stack in this course ensures that:

All students can receive consistent support and troubleshooting help
Course materials and examples work uniformly across all projects
Collaboration and peer learning are more effective
Real-world team environments require adherence to established tech stacks
Instructors can efficiently evaluate and grade projects with familiar tools

In professional development, teams must often work within existing technology constraints due to infrastructure, team expertise, and maintenance requirements. This course mirrors that reality.
